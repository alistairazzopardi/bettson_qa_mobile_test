1. Improve the flow between one test another by clearing cache and navigating back to homepage quickly
2. Parallel test execution (not required in this case, but tests may run much faster)
3. Configurable test case data - such as timings.
4. Testing e2e; (checking that UI was updated, but asserting that value has also been updated on the backend)
5. Device coverage (goes with parallel testing) - more devices with different sizes and models
